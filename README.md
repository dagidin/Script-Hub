# What is Script Hub?
This is a Roblox script hub, this supports only four games at this time, but I am constantly working on bringing more games to the table.
Along with this, script hub is the most skidded and detected piece of garbage to ever be written! /s

# How to Use?
In order to use Script Hub, you must execute the script below on an executor of your choice.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagidin/Script-Hub/main/Loader.lua"))()
```
If you want some settings disabled/enabled, open the folder which name is the name of the game you're in and open Script.lua, then just change the getgenv().Whatever value to false if you want it disabled and the value to true if you want it enabled.
