# Script Hub
Script Hub is without a doubt the simplest coded script hub, that isn't impressive, but the fact that I can code some scripts in less than 10 lines and still keep it undetected is the really impressive part!
This hub is dedicated to bringing a user-friendly experience to all it's users, if you want me to acknowledge your feedback join our Discord server! (coming soon)

This is a Roblox script hub, this supports only one game at this time, but I am constantly working on bringing more games to the table.
Along with this, Script Hub is completely non-skidded! Why would I skid something as simple as this?
