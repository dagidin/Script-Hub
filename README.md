# Script Hub
Script Hub is a simply coded script hub. This hub is a project I started because I was bored. If you have any suggestions feel free to dm me on Discord! (tag below)
I am by no means an experienced developer, I am only starting out and most games supported will be simple due to this.

# What is Script Hub?
Script Hub is a Roblox game hub, it's written in Luau and only supports a few Roblox games at this times. However, I am constantly working on bringing more games to the table
Some recommended executors to execute this script are:

# How to Use?
In order to use Script Hub, you must execute the script below on an executor of your choice.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagidin/Script-Hub/main/Loader.lua"))()
```
If you want some settings disabled/enabled, open the folder which name is the name of the game you're in and open Script.lua, then just change the getgenv().Whatever value to false if you want it disabled and the value to true if you want it enabled.
